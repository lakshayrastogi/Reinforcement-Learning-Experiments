# Reinforcement-Learning-Experiments
Experiments conducted as part of the RL course at IISc or further extensions of them.

### 1. 10-armed bandit
Evaluate how good greedy, e-greedy and UCB policies are with different learning parameters.

### 2. Cliff Walking
Evaluate how two algorithms (SARSA and Q-learning) perform in the cliff walking example with different learning parameters.

### 3. Grid World
Evaluate how the Monte Carlo first visit and every visit methods differ in their estimation of the values of the states.
